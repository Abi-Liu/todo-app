# todo-app
This is a CRUD app built utilizing Node.js/Express to build my own API. Users will be able to either create a new todo task, mark it complete or delete it altogether. All tasks will be stored in a MongoDB database.

Tech used: MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Javascript, EJS, CSS, HTML.

I plan to further build upon this project by adding a user authentication functionality which will allow for each individual user to store their own personalized to-do list.
